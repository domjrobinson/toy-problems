/*
Basic Set 1.3: Searching for an object in an array
Given a name (string) and an array of people (objects), find the person with the given name and return his/her hobby. Return false if there is no person with the given name.

DO NOT use people.find()

DO use a for loop.

TRY solving it with non-mutative recursion, only after youâ€™ve solved it using a for loop.

  for (var i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
    if (people[i].name === name) return people[i].hobby;

};
