/*
Basic Set 2.3: Finding all matching objects in an array
Given an array of players (objects), return the names of all players that have a score above 100.

DO NOT use .filter() in your solution.

DO use a for loop.

TRY solving it with non-mutative recursion, only after youâ€™ve solved it using a for loop.
